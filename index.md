Linux, and in particular the use of the command-line, has always been a training need when users have come from a Windows background in order to use Cardiff University’s Supercomputer (Hawk). This practical course will concentrate on the use of techniques to improve researchers’ understanding of the command line, use of common editing tools, and will answer any queries users may have in using the Linux interface.  
Whilst this course is tailored to help users quickly and easily run jobs on the supercomputer, many of these Linux commands are useful for general Linux systems.
